# PS4-AvatarDumperInjector_V2
Avatar Dumper and injector payload for Ps4 v2

This version of payload will work on 4.55 (untested),4.74(untested),5.05(working) or 6.72(working).

You must use a bin loader to use it at the moment

The payload will check if an USB key is connected and contain "Avatar_Inject" folder.                                                                        
The USB port is detected dynamicly
Avatar_Inject content will be copy to connected user dynamicly
An avatar backup will be done before the copy process 

When the copy is done, you must change user or reboot the ps4 to view the change.
This code is inspired by history_blocker from stooged
